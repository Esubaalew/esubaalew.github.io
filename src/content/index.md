I'm a software engineer passionate about the mathematical foundations of computer science. My work spans from systems programming in **Rust** to machine learning in **Python**.

Currently pursuing my **MSc in Artificial Intelligence** at Addis Ababa University while building production systems at **INTAPS**.

When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring algorithms, contributing to open source, or reading research papers.
