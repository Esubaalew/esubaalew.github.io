# Skills and Grades as an Information Systems Student

When I was in high school, my plan was straightforward: join university in tech-related fields, score good marks for good grades, and get hired fast. However, when I began my university journey at **Addis Ababa University** to attend Information Systems, I quickly realized that my grades weren't the only factor that mattered in getting a job after graduation. 

While good grades are important, so too are **skills and experience** in the field you want to work in.

## The Grade-Focused Culture

Unfortunately, I learned that most students in my academic program only care about their grades, not their skills. They study hard as the day of the exam approaches and get good marks and thus good grades. However, as an IS student, no skill or programming knowledge is acquired—only a list of **A, A+, and A-**.

Most teachers in the IS department don't care about whether students copied a previously submitted project or not. They give good marks to those who copied others' works and almost zero marks to those who do their projects themselves. Teachers discourage students who do their projects on their own, but encourage those who copy from others.

## The Problem with Grade-Only Success

This is a common problem in many academic programs, where grades are often seen as the **sole indicator of success**, rather than the acquisition of valuable skills and experience. However, in many cases, the ability to demonstrate practical skills and real-world experience can be just as important, if not more so, when it comes to securing a job or advancing in your career.

It's important to recognize that **grades are not the only factor** that will determine your success in your chosen career field. While good grades can certainly open doors and provide opportunities, they are not a guarantee of success. In order to truly excel, you must also be able to demonstrate:

- **Practical skills and experience**
- **Strong work ethic**
- **Willingness to learn and grow**
- **Real-world project portfolio**

## Taking Ownership of Your Education

If you find that your program is not adequately preparing you for the workforce, it may be worthwhile to **seek out additional training and experience on your own**. Consider:

### 1. **Gain Hands-On Experience**
Take on internships or volunteer opportunities that allow you to gain hands-on experience in your field.

### 2. **Self-Learning**
Seek out online courses and certifications that can help you build your skills and knowledge. Platforms like:
- Coursera
- Udemy
- freeCodeCamp
- The Odin Project

### 3. **Build Real Projects**
Create your own projects that solve real problems. This demonstrates initiative and practical ability far better than grades.

### 4. **Contribute to Open Source**
Join open-source projects on GitHub to learn from experienced developers and build your portfolio.

### 5. **Network and Connect**
Engage with tech communities, attend meetups, and connect with professionals in your field.

## My Personal Journey

Since realizing this gap, I've focused on:

- Building real projects in **Rust**, **Python**, and **C#**
- Contributing to open-source software
- Creating tools that solve actual problems (like [run-kit](https://github.com/Esubaalew/run))
- Freelancing to gain practical experience
- Constantly learning new technologies

These experiences taught me more than any grade ever could.

## The Bottom Line

**Ultimately, it's up to you to take ownership of your education and career path.** Don't be discouraged by the shortcomings of your academic program; instead, focus on developing your skills and experience in whatever ways you can. 

With determination, hard work, and a commitment to growth, you can succeed in your chosen field, **regardless of your grades**.

!!! tip "For Current Students"
    If you're in a similar situation, remember: employers hire based on what you can do, not what grades you got. Build your portfolio, develop real skills, and never stop learning.

## Conclusion

The education system has its flaws, but you don't have to be limited by them. Take control of your learning journey, build real skills, and create projects that showcase your abilities. In the tech world, what you can build matters infinitely more than what grades you earned.

Your future success depends on the skills you develop today, not the grades you received yesterday.
