## About Me

I'm a software engineer passionate about the mathematical foundations of computer science and their practical applications. My work spans from low-level systems programming in Rust and C++ to machine learning applications in Python.

Currently pursuing my **MSc in Artificial Intelligence** at Addis Ababa University while building production systems. I focus on writing code that is both mathematically sound and practically useful.

When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring algorithms, contributing to open source projects, or reading research papers on machine learning and systems design.
