## About Me

I'm fascinated by the mathematical foundations of computer science and their practical applications. My work spans from low-level systems programming in Rust and C++ to high-level machine learning applications in Python.

Currently pursuing my **MSc in Artificial Intelligence** at Addis Ababa University while building production systems that solve real-world problems. I believe in writing code that is both mathematically sound and practically useful.

When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring new algorithms, contributing to open source projects, or diving deep into research papers on machine learning and systems design.
